# Abaqus-VDFLUX-DFLUX-Subroutines-in-Fortran-Language-for-Welding-Simulation
In the project, we modeled welding in Abaqus using DFLUX subroutine. VDFLUX subroutine is an Abaqus tool, designed for thermal loading in form of body/surface fluxes, as a function of time, coordinates, etc. VDFLUX subroutine is available for the Abaqus Explicit solver, while its equivalent for the Standard solver is called DFLUX.We also have a free blog on our website that delves into the details of DFLUX/VDFLUX subroutines. You can access it through the provided link.

As shown in the figure below, the objective of this problem is to use DFLUX to analyze the welding between two plates, and the corresponding INP file is also attached.
